# Contributing to Siteworks

We are a small team of volunteers and all work part time on this project. We cannot yet commit to accepting contributions directly as pull requests so we propose to start each proposed contribution with a discussion.

The [GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/u3a-siteworks-development/discussions) should be your starting point. Please only raise an issue or pull request if you've been recommended to do so after discussion.

2) Contributions should start out with a discussion. Possible bugs may be raised as a "Potential Issue" discussion, feature requests may be raised as an "Ideas" discussion. We can then determine if the discussion needs to be escalated into an "Issue" or not, or if we'd consider a pull request.

Try to be as descriptive as you can and in case of a bug report, provide as much information as possible.
